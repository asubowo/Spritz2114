{"name":"Quick Reader (Formally known as Spritz2114)","tagline":"An Android Project for CS2114","body":"# Train yourself to read faster than ever!\r\n\r\nWelcome to Quick Reader, a group project greatly based on the techniques by Spritz.\r\n\r\n## How the heck does Spritz or Quick Reader work?\r\n\r\nEssentially, Quick Reader attempts to center every word around a common area, reducing the amount of time your eyes have to 'travel' in order to read the entire word. By having your eyes just center and zone in on a common word, we can accelerate the words shown per minute and effectively comprehend what's being displayed.\r\n\r\n## How do I install this?\r\n\r\nThis app will never be released on Google Play. You are more than welcome to download the project and compile it yourself to generate the .apk.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
