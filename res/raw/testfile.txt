Welcome to the Quick Reader.

This android mobile application is useful for reading text in a quick
and effective manner. After using this application a user will be able
to read any text quickly and with better comprehension than ever
before.

In order to get started simply navigate to your favorite web-site and
copy some text. Then return to the application and paste the text in
the text box below labeled "Paste Text". Once pasted select the
appropriate words per a minute (WPM) from the choices. Then press play
to see your text displayed by the application at the selected speed.

If at any point you get lost in the text simply press "Pause" and then
navigate to the appropriate place in the text using "Next" and
"Previous". If you'd like to choose a new block of text simply press
"Reset" and then copy and paste some new text into the box to start
again.

Enjoy!
